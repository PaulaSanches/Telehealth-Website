        <h1>Risks Associated with TeleHealth Systems</h1>
        <p>In the area of Telehealth there are many key concepts surrounding the risks topic. These topics can be broadly expressed as Data security and storage, Authentication of users, Equality of Use, Risk of incorrect diagnosis, Emergency situations and the prescription of drugs.  </p>
        <p>Data Security and Storage:            Likely the most important risk to address when handling Telehealth is the risk to data security. Telehealth systems handle sensitive private data about its patients which naturally puts a target on its back for hackers to leak data for their own personal gain by selling data for identity theft purposes. Any form of data leak will take a huge hit to user trust, which is extremely detrimental to the telehealth system as the public will struggle to trust the systems to store their data and force them into traditional routes of healthcare. To ensure a high level of security, end to end encryption is a requirement for every action taken on the system, from the video calls to the messages between colleagues. According to the Medical Council of New Zealand, ensuring the confidentiality of patient information is paramount, and healthcare providers must use secure systems to prevent data breaches. The Healthcare and public health sector coordinating council recently produced a guidance paper on the how to secure data fin a Telehealth system. "Within the provider environment, management should establish a well-defined process to address the scope of a technology procurement project and how it will be deployed and managed from end to end."  (Health Sector Council, 2023).</p>
        <p>Equality of Use:         As telehealth's majour use cases occur in the rural population and the physically disadvantaged communities, equality of use is a risk too. Rural users may have higher technological barriers as they may be less experienced with technology. This means that the systems need to be very intuitive and simplistic to help the less technically literate users to use the system. The rural community generally has poor internet connectivity and so the system needs to be useable with low data streaming use cases in order to be useful to the broadest range of users. The National Telehealth Service highlights that reliable broadband internet is essential for the success of telehealth, which can be a challenge in some regions​ (Te Whatu Ora – Health New Zealand, n.d.). The physically disadvantaged community will require unique help due to fine motor skills being difficult in some cases. This means the system will require either handsfree use or excellent accessibility features to allow users to navigate the system while having minor input.</p>
        <p>Authentication of Users:            Due to the nature of Telehealth and its reliance on private data to make quick assessments of a patient, user authentication is important to judge who the professional is talking to. New Zealand already has a good user authentication program that is used for many other sensitive data use cases such as IRD, student loans and many other government services. This can lay a good ground level for user security however there should be levels to the security such as video confirmation. Two factor authentication may be used to further increase security for hacking threats, however this may lead to less technically adept users being pushed away for their lack of understanding. Either clear instructions must be used or another method of authentication such as photo identification.</p>
        <p>Emergency Situations:            Telehealth, being purely online, cannot help patients in the same way as a general practitioner in the case of an emergency, however there should be clear protocol set in place for these situations. A list of emergency clinics around the country so that the time spent searching for help can be minimised. Pre-written emergency procedures may be useful for explaining how to help the patient to a caretaker to stabilise the patient before emergency care can arrive. </p> 
        <p>Risk of incorrect diagnosis:            The over the internet nature of the system means that diagnosis of certain conditions may be difficult and still require an in-person meeting to check for physical symptoms. Telehealth will not be able to help all patients the same, however it would serve a use to filter out some of the stress on the health system by handling the cases that an in person consultancy is not required for.</p>
        <p> Prescriptions:            The risks of miss-prescribing users is important as some prescription drugs are highly addictive and can ruin lives if miss-used. The Medical Council Statement on telehealth states that before prescribing any medicine for the first time to a patient, an in-person consultation is expected, however if that is not possible a video consultation may suffice along with discussing the patients treatment with another registered health practitioner who can verify the patients data and identity (Medical Council of New Zealand, 2020).</p>
