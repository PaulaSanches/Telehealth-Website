        <h1><strong>TOPIC</strong></h1>
        <p>COVID-19 created an urgency for healthcare to change its services, protect doctors, nurses, caregivers and patients to reduce the congestion in hospitals and not spread the virus.</p>

        <p>Telehealth refers to “the distribution of medical services by healthcare practitioners over long distances by the application of information technologies and networking to share 
            accurate and correct information regarding patient evaluations, treatments, therapies, and appointments accessible”.</p>
            
        <p>There were reported numerous benefits of telehealth services, in non-emergency situations consultations, and therapies where the treatments are based on keeping the safety of both 
            sides of the line.</p>
            
        <p>Telehealth and Telemedicine are related but are distinct between them. Telemedicine is considered direct clinical health services using telecommunication technology. It is a technological 
            takeaway for health services. Telehealth has increased in popularity with the advancement of the internet and the development of web-based applications integrated with cloud management to 
            deliver well-being and monitor health conditions.</p>
            
        <p>Telehealth has provided a cost-saving advantage and effort-saving. Telehealth is a bridge between the patient in a remote area and the physician on the other end. Despite all the developments
            in providing good-faith of healthcare some concerns are rising. As long there is a lack of standards and guidelines to regulate telehealth there is a lacuna issue with legal and cyber matters. 
            Cyber threats are a major concern in telehealth. Secondly, moving from one application to another includes that all the data on that app were transferred to the next, resulting in a loss of confidence. 
            The third issue is the technical barrier. Technical matters are related especially in first users to web-based applications or even telemonitoring video consultations on both sides. These difficulties 
            disappear with the guidance or support of the technical staff. Moreover, if related to older adults, including those with cognitive decline and vision impairment the issue is quite bigger.</p>
