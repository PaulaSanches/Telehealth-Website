        <h1>Choices: Legal and Ethical Implications</h1>
        <p>It is vital to consider the choices that emerge as a result of implementing telehealth in society, both ethically and legally. Firstly, the incorporation of telehealth may further exacerbate the disparity in health services provided as it may not be a feasible solution for some populations that have limited access to technology.</p>
        <p>For example, those living in countries at war or rural areas, elderly demographics with limited computer literacy, or individuals that simply have no access to the Internet or technology will not be able to use this service. Even in New Zealand, those with no Internet connection as of the beginning of 2024 represent 4.3% of the total population; consequently, this would not be a viable solution for approximately 224 thousand people (Kemp, 2024). </p> 
        <p>This introduces the ethical choice as to whether telehealth integration will benefit the society as a whole despite further disadvantaging populations that may already be vulnerable or have limited access to services. </p>
        <p>Furthermore, because telehealth would be implemented to replace certain face-to-face medical services, relying on technology as an intermediate may also lead to choices as to how this would impact society. With less direct face-to-face contact, there may be an increased likelihood of incorrect information being relayed and a possible deterioration in the quality of health services provided. For example, this may be from incorrect data input while using telemonitoring, or because of improper physical examination as the clinician cannot physically be present in the room. This allows the choice as to whether telehealth should ethically be used to replace traditional face-to-face healthcare, particularly for complex cases wherein the patient would require multidisciplinary care that online services alone cannot replace (Hull et al., 2022). Similarly, this also introduces the possibility of patients exploiting the idea of less face-to-face interaction and exaggerating the severity of their condition to be prescribed drug (Hull et al., 2022). Furthermore, due to the ease of providing teleservices, clinicians may become over-reliant on teleservices as a replacement for physical medical care. The availability of this choice for clinicians may result in fewer in-person visits to areas that are less accessible, even when mandatory, leading to a larger disparity of health services provided to those living in these regions (The Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners, 2017).  </p>
        <p>Another pertinent point to consider is the novelty of this system and how this would affect ethical choices in its implementation. As the systems are still new, there will be limitations to the extent that machines will be able to help when giving recommendations or predictions for diagnoses from using telemonitoring services. This is especially so when accounting for minority groups that may not have as much research or statistics conducted for them such as Maori or Pacific populations, those living rurally, or those with disabilities (OPMCSA, 2023). </p>
        <p>The legal choices introduced by integrating telehealth into our society should also be considered. Naturally, several regulations bind health practitioners, including those practicing via telemedicine. All regulated healthcare providers must adhere to the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act (Ministry of Health, 2003). This acts to protect patients by ensuring practitioners maintain and update their standard of professional practice with the most recent practices, renew their annual practicing certificates, ensures professionals only practice within their defined scope of practice, and protects certain titles from being used by unqualified individuals (Ministry of Health, 2003). The Medicines Act 1981 defines drugs and medicines, as well as regulates their prescription and distribution along the pharmaceutical chain (Ministry of Health, 2023). As medicine is a heavily regulated field with the potential for many ramifications should it not be properly regulated, the legal choices that may be introduced from incorporating telehealth into the current standard of practice should carefully be considered before widespread integration. </p>
        <p>Similarly, due to the high level of contact and potential risk of harm that general practice carries, patients also hold rights; telehealth practitioners would also need to adhere to and fulfil these rights.  Specifically in New Zealand, there are ten rights that patients have that all healthcare professionals must comply with, as per the Health & Disability Commissioner Act 2020 (Ministry of Health, 1994). These include (but are not limited to) the right to confidentiality, informed consent and decision-making, respectful and dignified treatment, cultural respect (Ministry of Health, 1994). It is mandatory that telehealth be chosen to be integrated into society in a manner that acknowledges these rights. </p>
        <p>Due to the potential for high risks, contractual arrangements of liability in certain circumstances that arise from telehealth practice and their associated choices should be considered legally. This may include a conversation of which telehealth services will be covered by insurance companies should malpractice occur. To limit this, when considering legal choices that arise from the integration of telehealth, it is vital that the limitations of telehealth be carefully considered and the scope of practice be consequently altered and regulated accordingly. This includes how telehealth patients will be cared for should they require emergency care, and what protocols will be in place to attend to this. </p>â€ƒ
