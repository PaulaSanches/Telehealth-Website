        <h1>Opportunities for telehealth: What it can offer for current issues in healthcare</h1><br>
        <h2>Current challenges in society:</h2>
        <div class = "text1">Healthcare access:</div>
        <div class = "text2">
            About 1 in 4 New Zealanders live in rural areas or small towns (Health New Zealand, 2024), which includes small urban areas, rural settlements and rural other.
            <div class = "text3">
                A rural settlement is defined as having at least 200 residents and at least 1 community or public building (Stats NZ, 2023).
                Almost half of the people mentioned above live in more isolated areas than those rural settlements (Stats NZ, n.d.).
                So, almost 1 in 8 Kiwis likely do not have reliable access to healthcare services e.g. hospitals, clinics, pharmacies,...
                To some of us, a hospital is just a short drive away, but for many others, checkups are inconvenient, time-consuming, or even downright financially prohibitive.
            </div>
            
            
            However, there are higher percentages of children and the elderly living rurally than in cities (Health New Zealand, 2024). These are the most vulnerable groups and need healthcare the most.
        </div>
        <div class = "text1">Staff availability:</div>
        <div class = "text2">
            Healthcare, especially frontline healthcare, is typically underfunded and understaffed, according to Charlesworth et al. (2015).
            <div class = "text3">
                Frontline health workers are those who provide services directly to the general public, so think doctors, nurses, midwives, pharmacists, etc...
                These are the most essential roles, especially in rural healthcare, as they can take care of the majority of cases.
                Being understaffed means that they likely won't be able to work efficiently, or even be available when most needed.
            </div>
            New Zealand healthcare funding is also planned to be reduced, ranging from 0.6 to 1.2 percent of each district's budget.
            Notably, "health unions have warned the constraints will impact medical care" (Pennington, 2024).
            This may strain healthcare services and negatively affect the availability of healthcare in rural places.
        </div>
        
        <h2>Telehealth technologies will bring:</h2>
        <div class = "text1">Quicker, or even almost instaneous services to patients, as long as they have an Internet connection:</div>
        <div class = "text2">		
            This will help minimise risk, as issues can be identified and dealt withh sooner.
            Travel time and costs are also reduced for patients, encouraging more people to utilise healtcare services especially in the countryside.
            More importantly, it helps open up more healthcare opportunities for remote places like the mountains or small islands, especially for specialist care (Kalman et al., 2023; Luscombe et al., 2021).
        </div>
        <div class = "text1">Not just patients, healthcare workers can also benefit greatly from telehealth:</div>
        <div class = "text2">
            Less travel time and costs means medical staff is better distributed throughout New Zealand.
            Additional doctors from large hospital can be quickly diverted to rural areas to act as relief for places that are understaffed or busy.
            Not only does this improve efficiency, it also allows local practitioners to focus better on more serious cases that need physical intervention.
            Furthermore, there will also be an increase in diversity in cases and patients available to each doctor, improving their skill and reducing isolation (Luscombe et al., 2021)
        </div>
        <div class = "text1">The benefits would be more evident in mental healthcare:</div>
        <div class = "text2">
            In many cases in-person meeting is not necessary.
            For instance, a therapy session can be conducted in-person, but it can also be done through phone or video calls.
            In fact, many therapists already offer online sessions (teletherapy).
            Telehealth also means that more people can utilise these services in their own convenience, encouraging more to seek help.
            This can hopefully bring more awareness about mental health issues in society, as these are often overlooked compared to physical ones.
            Many also prefer the anonymity of telehealth than physical meet-ups.
            Some might be able to open up and work on their issues better through texts or phone calls than face-to-face (Kalman et al., 2023).
        </div>
        <div class = "text1">Better prevention and treatment for infectious diseases, as medical workers can provide instructions on isolation and self-care for patients without having to physically travel there:</div>
        <div class = "text2">		
            This means that quarantine can be done faster and more efficiently, as it minimises direct contact, preventing further spread of diseases.
            It also puts less risk and stress onto the health workers themselves, making more staff available during a pandemic.
            These topics are especially relevant after the recent COVID-19 pandemic, notably when it was reported that many staff lacked personal protective equipment (Wild, 2022).
            With telehealth, less healthcare workers would need to be on-site, which may help alleviate this issue in similar situations in the future.
        </div>
        <div class = "text1">Furthermore, telehealth can also act as a testbed for new, experimental technologies e.g. AI, robots, etc...</div>
        <div class = "text2">
            For example, telepresence robots are being tested in providing care to patients instead of nurses (Leoste, 2024).
        </div>
